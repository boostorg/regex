      <P>Boost.regex&nbsp;provides extensive support for run-time localization, the 
         localization model used can be split into two parts: front-end and back-end.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Front-end localization deals with everything which the user sees - error 
         messages, and the regular expression syntax itself. For example a French 
         application could change [[:word:]] to [[:mot:]] and \w to \m. Modifying the 
         front end locale requires active support from the developer, by providing the 
         library with a message catalogue to load, containing the localized strings. 
         Front-end locale is affected by the LC_MESSAGES category only.
      </P>
      <P>Back-end localization deals with everything that occurs after the expression 
         has been parsed - in other words everything that the user does not see or 
         interact with directly. It deals with case conversion, collation, and character 
         class membership. The back-end locale does not require any intervention from 
         the developer - the library will acquire all the information it requires for 
         the current locale from the underlying operating system / run time library. 
         This means that if the program user does not interact with regular expressions 
         directly - for example if the expressions are embedded in your C++ code - then 
         no explicit localization is required, as the library will take care of 
         everything for you. For example embedding the expression [[:word:]]+ in your 
         code will always match a whole word, if the program is run on a machine with, 
         for example, a Greek locale, then it will still match a whole word, but in 
         Greek characters rather than Latin ones. The back-end locale is affected by the 
         LC_TYPE and LC_COLLATE categories.
      </P>
      <P>There are three separate localization mechanisms supported by boost.regex:</P>
      <P><I>Win32 localization model.</I>
      </P>
      <P>This is the default model when the library is compiled under Win32, and is 
         encapsulated by the traits class w32_regex_traits. When this model is in effect 
         there is a single global locale as defined by the user's control panel 
         settings, and returned by GetUserDefaultLCID. All the settings used by 
         boost.regex are acquired directly from the operating system bypassing the C run 
         time library. Front-end localization requires a resource dll, containing a 
         string table with the user-defined strings. The traits class exports the 
         function:
      </P>
      <P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s);
      </P>
      <P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the resource 
         dll, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not 
         necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances):
      </P>
      <P>boost::w32_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_catalogue("mydll.dll");
      </P>
      <P>Note that this API sets the dll name for <I>both</I> the narrow and wide 
         character specializations of w32_regex_traits.
      </P>
      <P>This model does not currently support thread specific locales (via 
         SetThreadLocale under Windows NT), the library provides full Unicode support 
         under NT, under Windows 9x the library degrades gracefully - characters 0 to 
         255 are supported, the remainder are treated as "unknown" graphic characters.
      </P>
      <P><I>C localization model.</I>
      </P>
      <P>This is the default model when the library is compiled under an operating 
         system other than Win32, and is encapsulated by the traits class <I>c_regex_traits</I>, 
         Win32 users can force this model to take effect by defining the pre-processor 
         symbol BOOST_REGEX_USE_C_LOCALE. When this model is in effect there is a single 
         global locale, as set by <I>setlocale</I>. All settings are acquired from your 
         run time library, consequently Unicode support is dependent upon your run time 
         library implementation. Front end localization requires a POSIX message 
         catalogue. The traits class exports the function:
      </P>
      <P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s);
      </P>
      <P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the message 
         catalogue, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not 
         necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances):
      </P>
      <P>boost::c_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_catalogue("mycatalogue");
      </P>
      <P>Note that this API sets the dll name for <I>both</I> the narrow and wide 
         character specializations of c_regex_traits. If your run time library does not 
         support POSIX message catalogues, then you can either provide your own 
         implementation of &lt;nl_types.h&gt; or define BOOST_RE_NO_CAT to disable 
         front-end localization via message catalogues.
      </P>
      <P>Note that calling <I>setlocale</I> invalidates all compiled regular 
         expressions, calling <TT>setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")</TT> will make this library 
         behave equivalent to most traditional regular expression libraries including 
         version 1 of this library.
      </P>
      <P><I><TT>C++ </TT></I><I>localization</I><I><TT> </TT></I><I>model</I><I><TT>.</TT></I>
      </P>
      <P>This model is only in effect if the library is built with the pre-processor 
         symbol BOOST_REGEX_USE_CPP_LOCALE defined. When this model is in effect each 
         instance of reg_expression&lt;&gt; has its own instance of std::locale, class 
         reg_expression&lt;&gt; also has a member function <I>imbue</I> which allows the 
         locale for the expression to be set on a per-instance basis. Front end 
         localization requires a POSIX message catalogue, which will be loaded via the 
         std::messages facet of the expression's locale, the traits class exports the 
         symbol:
      </P>
      <P>static std::string set_message_catalogue(const std::string&amp; s);
      </P>
      <P>which needs to be called with a string identifying the name of the message 
         catalogue, <I>before</I> your code compiles any regular expressions (but not 
         necessarily before you construct any <I>reg_expression</I> instances):
      </P>
      <P>boost::cpp_regex_traits&lt;char&gt;::set_message_catalogue("mycatalogue");
      </P>
      <P>Note that calling reg_expression&lt;&gt;::imbue will invalidate any expression 
         currently compiled in that instance of reg_expression&lt;&gt;. This model is 
         the one which closest fits the ethos of the C++ standard library, however it is 
         the model which will produce the slowest code, and which is the least well 
         supported by current standard library implementations, for example I have yet 
         to find an implementation of std::locale which supports either message 
         catalogues, or locales other than "C" or "POSIX".
      </P>
      <P>Finally note that if you build the library with a non-default localization 
         model, then the appropriate pre-processor symbol (BOOST_REGEX_USE_C_LOCALE or 
         BOOST_REGEX_USE_CPP_LOCALE) must be defined both when you build the support 
         library, and when you include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt; or 
         &lt;boost/cregex.hpp&gt; in your code. The best way to ensure this is to add 
         the #define to &lt;boost/regex/user.hpp&gt;.
      </P>
      <P><I>Providing a message catalogue:</I>
      </P>
      <P>In order to localize the front end of the library, you need to provide the 
         library with the appropriate message strings contained either in a resource 
         dll's string table (Win32 model), or a POSIX message catalogue (C or C++ 
         models). In the latter case the messages must appear in message set zero of the 
         catalogue. The messages and their id's are as follows:
         <BR>
         &nbsp;
      </P>

      <P>Finally, custom collating element names are loaded starting from message id 
         400, and terminating when the first load thereafter fails. Each message looks 
         something like: "tagname string" where <I>tagname</I> is the name used inside 
         [[.tagname.]] and <I>string</I> is the actual text of the collating element. 
         Note that the value of collating element [[.zero.]] is used for the conversion 
         of strings to numbers - if you replace this with another value then that will 
         be used for string parsing - for example use the Unicode character 0x0660 for 
         [[.zero.]] if you want to use Unicode Arabic-Indic digits in your regular 
         expressions in place of Latin digits.
      </P>
      <P>
      Note that the POSIX defined names for character classes and collating elements 
      are always available - even if custom names are defined, in contrast, custom 
      error messages, and custom syntax messages replace the default ones.
